assumes you already have npm, python, node installed
"npm install -g windows-build-tools" (might need to manually do the visual studio launcher, add the v140/v141 tools in the individual components view)
clone repository (might need to install GIT and add to PATH if you want to use command line)
"npm install" (in repository directory)
customize .env
"node index.js" (in repository directory)
